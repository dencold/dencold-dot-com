Hasper is a theme for the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that I started hacking primarily for the purposes of serving up content on my own blog [dencold.com](http://www.dencold.com). It sources *heavily* from the beautiful [casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme by the folks at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), hence the name: "Hasper". If you like the styling of casper and use hugo, Hasper may be just what you are looking for.

You can get a sense for what the Hasper theme looks like by browsing around this site. Hasper is responsible for the layout and presentation of everything you see. I also run the latest version of the code here.

Hasper is open source (MIT licensed) and can be found on github at: https://github.com/dencold/hasper. The README there goes into more detail on how you can install and use Hasper/Hugo for your own personal website.

I welcome comments and feedback via [github issues](https://github.com/dencold/hasper/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/dencold/hasper/pulls). Please let me know if you are using the theme and how it can be improved.

### Features

Hapser has a couple of nice features out of the box:

- multiple author support via standard hugo metadata
- linking to individual author bio pages
- beautiful cover/banner image support
- configurable sharing buttons for post details
- full support for [highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/) themes
- splash image size user-configurable

I keep a [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dencold/hasper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and use SemVer to help keep users abreast of any changes that may affect them.

### Attribution

Hasper was originally [a fork](https://github.com/dencold/hugo-theme-casper) of the [hugo-theme-casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper). However, the original author was not responding to [pull requests](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper/pull/41), and I had several changes I needed, so I decided to create Hasper instead.
